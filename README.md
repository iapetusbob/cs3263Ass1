# CS3263 Assignments

Hi, welcome to CS3263 assignment 1! You can complete all problems in [the main notebook](./main.ipynb) with detailed instructions.

After you complete your codes, **Please remember to copy your solutions into [the `programming.py` script](./programming.py)** for our evaluation.

The programming part will be auto-graded on [CodePost](https://codepost.io/) platform.
- You will receive an email to create and activate your CodePost account. 
- You don't need to submit to CodePost, we will import your submissions from Canvas.
- Note the `programming.py` file is designed for auto-grading, so you can't run it normally from your end but don't worry. 
- In the `programming.py` script, **DO NOT** modify any code outside the blocks you're allowed to, **DO NOT** print any other message.

Your submission should zipped and named as `netid1-netid2.zip`. The folder structure should be **strictly** formed as follows:

```
netid1-netid2.zip
|---programming.py
|---main.ipynb
```
